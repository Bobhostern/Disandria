<h1>Welcome to Disandria!</h1>

<p>Disandria is an RPG game, whose storyline I will soon develop, and, once finished, I will release on RMN (rpgmaker.net). <br />
This repository is simply the engine, also referred to as Disandria. <br />
To build Disandria, you will need to get (on your own):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.sfml-dev.org" title="SFML">The SFML library</a> Version 2.0 or later required. Do <strong>NOT</strong> get Version 1.6. It will <strong>NOT</strong> compile. The coding standards changed between the two versions, so that causes an incompatibility with SFML-1.6 and SFML-2.0+.  </li>
<li><a href="http://www.pocoproject.org" title="Poco">The Poco C++ library</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://www.cegui.org.uk" title="CEGUI-mk2">The CEGUI-mk2 library</a> CEGUI-mk2 (Version 0.8 or later...)  </li>
<li><a href="http://www.bromeon.ch/libraries/thor/index.html" title="Thor">The Thor library</a> I'm not sure if Version 1.1 works with SFML-2.0 or SFML-2.1, but the best bet is to go with Thor 2.0.  </li>
<li><a href="http://www.falconpl.org" title="FalconPL">The Falcon Programming Language</a> An wonderful project I stumbled across. Completely in C++. Easily integrated as an embeddable scripting language. A quite extensive standard library. The default scripting language of Disandria.  </li>
</ul>

<p>For those of you who want to use what I used, here are the version numbers: <br />
SFML: 2.1 <br />
Poco: 1.4.6p2 <br />
CEGUI: 0.8.2 <br />
Thor: 2.0-dev <br />
FalconPL: 0.9.6.8 (Chimera)  </p>

<p>PugiXML is used in this project. The files for PugiXML are included in the folder src/pugixml.
I do not own nor do I hold any rights over PugiXML. <br />
For more information on this project, look over here: <a href="http://www.pugixml.org" title="PugiXML">The PugiXML library</a>.</p>

<p>There are some limitations to the engine:</p>

<h3>Map-related</h3>

<ul>
<li>You can only use Tiled TMX maps in their <em>XML</em> format.  </li>
<li>The engine currently does <em>not</em> support TMX terrains. <br />
PugiTMX cannot currently parse TMX terrains, and I don't know what they do, so no terrains right now.</li>
<li>The engine currently does <em>not</em> support TMX image layers.
PugiTMX cannot currently parse TMX image layers, and I don't know what they do, so no image layers either.</li>
<li>Maps <em>must</em> be orthagonal.
I've never used an isometric map. I don't know if my renderer can handle isometric maps, but try at your own downfall...</li>
<li>Maps <em>must</em> be in a folder with the <em>exact</em> filename of the map (without the .tmx).
This is so the engine can find them, and as I add scripting, everything is all in the same folder, and everything won't be mixed with each other. </li>
<li>Also, the map file must have the extension .tmx. This is the default extension for Tiled <strong>TMX</strong> XML maps, so...</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sound-related</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>The audio formats the engine supports are:</p>

<pre><code>- ogg 
- wav
- flac
- aiff
- au
- raw
- paf
- svx
- nist
- voc
- ircam
- w64
- mat4
- mat5 pvf
- htk
- sds
- avr
- sd2
- caf
- wve
- mpc2k
- rf64
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<h3>Scripting-related</h3>

<ul>
<li>The default scripting language will be Falcon. I may add more in the future...</li>
</ul>

<h2>A bit of Information on the Projects inside this Project</h2>

<h3>PugiTMX</h3>

<p>PugiTMX is a TMX map parser, written in C++ (obviously), based on the PugiXML parser. <br />
I wrote it to see if I could. </p>

<p><strong>Thank you for your interest in Disandria!</strong></p>
