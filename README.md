# Welcome to Disandria!

Disandria is an RPG game, whose storyline I will soon develop, and, once finished, I will release on RMN (rpgmaker.net).
To build Disandria, you will need:

*  [The SFML library](http://www.sfml-dev.org "SFML")
*  [The Poco C++ library](http://www.pocoproject.org "Poco")
*  [The CEGUI-mk2 library (v0.8+)](http://www.cegui.org.uk "CEGUI-mk2")
*  (TBI) [The SDL library](http://www.libsdl.org "SDL")

PugiXML is used in this project. I do not own nor do I hold any rights over PugiXML.  
For more information on this project, look over here: [PugiXML library][pxml].

Thank you for your interest in Disandria!
