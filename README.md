# Welcome to Disandria!

Disandria is an RPG game, whose storyline I will soon develop, and, once finished, I will release on RMN (rpgmaker.net).
To build Disandria, you will need:
	+ [The SFML library](www.sfml-dev.org)
	+ [The Poco C++ library](www.pocoproject.org)
	+ [The CEGUI-mk2 library (v0.8+)](www.cegui.org.uk)
	+ (TBI) [The SDL library](www.libsdl.org)

Thank you for your interest in Disandria!
